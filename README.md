--------

To install the necessary libraries, run the below command

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Run the notebook ```Machine Learning with Signal Processing techniques.ipynb ``` to reproduce the results.

If interested to run only LSTM, run the below command in terminal

```project_home_directory$ python src/models/train_model.py```
